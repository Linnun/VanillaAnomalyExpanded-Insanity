	<VAEI_InhumanizedDesc>{PAWN_nameDef}’s connection to humanity is broken. {PAWN_possessive} transformation has left {PAWN_objective} detached from human sensibilities, no longer swayed by pain or social interactions, and indifferent to the aesthetics of beauty and the outdoors. {PAWN_possessive} mind, now attuned to the void, disregards most emotions, finding solace in void meditation and a mysterious, unyielding joy that permeates {PAWN_possessive} existence.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} has gained the inhumanized trait.\n\nThough drastically altered, {PAWN_nameDef} is still part of your faction, just disconnected from the typical human experiences.</VAEI_InhumanizedDesc>

	<VAEI_RecoveredDesc>{PAWN_nameDef} has emerged from the depths of madness, experiencing a catharsis that has restored a measure of sanity to {PAWN_possessive} mind. The suffocating grip of the void that once dominated {PAWN_possessive} thoughts has loosened, granting {PAWN_possessive} a fragile peace. Though the journey back to full sanity will be lengthy, {PAWN_pronoun} has regained crucial aspects of {PAWN_possessive} mental clarity.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} has begun the slow process of recovery, and did not become inhumanized on this occasion.</VAEI_RecoveredDesc>

Compelled by the dark calling, {PAWN_possessive} is now driven to end {PAWN_possessive} existence in a final act of sacrifice to the void.\n\n{PAWN_pronoun} has gained the inhumanized trait.\n\n{PAWN_nameDef} is now set on a path of self-destruction and will attempt to end {PAWN_possessive} existence, however {PAWN_pronoun} can still be restrained and stopped if you arrest them in time.</VAEI_SacrificialDesc>

{PAWN_nameDef} will unfortunately remain forever prone to losing {PAWN_possessive} mind once again, even more so than others. Any negative effects on sanity will be doubled, which might cause {PAWN_nameDef} to become inhumanized again.</VAEI_RehumanizedDesc>
